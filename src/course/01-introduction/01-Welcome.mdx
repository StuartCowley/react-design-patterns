# Welcome to React Design Patterns! ðŸ¥³

You have taken your first step into learning about React Design Patterns! I am soo excited to show you loads of different
techniques with real world examples alongside those techniques in which you can apply in your day to day development with React.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for developers who want to take the next step in their career by learning more advanced
techniques for building React applications.

## What will you learn in this course?

If you are like me who doesn't absorb information they see unless they're applying it to their daily work then this course is for you! React is a huge part of our software development lives now and this course is to help you to:

- Recognise current patterns implemented by NPM packages or components in your projects
- Correct any code that isn't following that pattern
- Learn what patterns work best for which component
- Will be able to write components that scale better across larger applications

## What level do you need to be to do these course?

If you do not know React then it might be worth [learning React](https://react.dev/) before doing this course. If you do know React great! Ideally you will need to know a little bit about:

- React hooks
- React API
- React class components (only for one of the courses)
- Understand state and props

I will be going in high detail on each of the lessons so if there are some holes in your React knowledge I will make sure those holes are filled and covered in the lessons content.

## Contents

Each lesson is broken down in an exercise file and a final file. The excercise file will have instructions in puesdo format to help guide you through the code snippets. Not to worry though, there will be videos to support you along the way.
